# Bottom_of_the_barrel
A web scraper for beer prices.
Current plan is to run locally once a week to a local host MongoDb server. 
Will migrate data to the cloud and serve directly to a low weight front end.

Currently working for:
# DanMurphys
- https://www.danmurphys.com.au/beer/all
# LiquorLand
- https://www.liquorland.com.au/Beer
# BWS
- https://bws.com.au/beer/craft-beer

Front end hosted here:

#Current TODO:
Duplicate protection
Update existing documents with new price data & maintain history
Make sure BWS Multi-category scrape is working
